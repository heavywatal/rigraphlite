\title{Create arbitrary dimensional lattices}
\usage{
graph_square_lattice(
  dim,
  nei = 1L,
  directed = FALSE,
  mutual = FALSE,
  circular = FALSE
)

graph_ring(n, directed = FALSE, mutual = FALSE, circular = TRUE)

# graph_lattice = graph_square_lattice
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{An integer vector giving the sizes of the lattice in each of its dimensions.}

\item{nei}{An integer distance within which two vertices will be connected.}

\item{directed}{A logical value, whether to consider directed paths.
Ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{mutual}{A logical, whether to create mutual edges in directed graphs.}

\item{circular}{A logical, whether to create a closed ring/cycle or an open path.}

\item{n}{An integer value, the number of vertices.}
}
\value{
An \code{\link{igraph_ptr}} object.
}
\description{
A ring/cycle graph is a special case of a lattice graph with one dimension.
