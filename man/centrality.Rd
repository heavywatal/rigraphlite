\arguments{
\item{graph}{An \code{\link{igraph_ptr}} object.}

\item{...}{Unused, but temporarily included to avoid silent bugs and
to prompt users to cope with breaking changes in version 1.0.}

\item{weights}{A numeric vector of edge weights; \code{TRUE} to use \code{Eattr(graph, "weight")}.}

\item{eids}{An integer vector of edge IDs.}

\item{directed}{A logical value, whether to consider directed paths.
Ignored for undirected graphs.}

\item{normalized}{A logical value, whether to normalize the result.}

\item{from}{An integer vector of vertex IDs.}

\item{to}{An integer vector of vertex IDs.}
}
\value{
\code{edge_betweenness()} returns a numeric vector of edge betweenness
for each edge in the graph.

\code{edge_betweenness_subset()} is a variant of \code{edge_betweenness()}
that computes the betweenness using a subset of paths between \code{from} and \code{to}.
}
\description{
The betweenness centrality of an edge is the number of geodesics going through it.

\examples{
g = graph_tree(5L)

edge_betweenness_subset(g, from = Vsource(g), to = Vsink(g))
